 * Represents the game board made up of multiple fields.
 *
 * There are two ways to create a board:
 * 1. By passing a size and a rule that marks certain fields as branching.
 * 2. By passing a custom list of Field objects (used in tests or advanced setups).
 *
 * @property cells List of all fields on the board.
 * @property size Total number of fields (auto-calculated from the list).
